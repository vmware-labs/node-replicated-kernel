# Continuous integration (CI)

We run tests using the github-actions infrastructure. The following steps are
necessary to set-up a new runner machine (and connect a github repo to it).

Steps to add a new CI machine:

  1. [Install github-runner software on a new test machine](#install-github-runner-software-on-a-new-test-machine)
  1. [Give access to the benchmark repository](#give-access-to-the-benchmark-repository)
  1. [Configure software for the `github-runner` account](#configure-software-for-the-github-runner-account)
  1. [Disable AppArmor](#disable-apparmor)
  1. [Install a recent QEMU](#install-a-recent-qemu)
  1. [Do a test-run](#do-a-test-run)
  1. [Start the new runner](#start-the-runner)

## Install github-runner software on a new test machine

Create a github-runner user first:

```bash
sudo useradd github-runner -m -s /bin/zsh
```

Add sudo capability for github-runner:

```bash
sudo visudo
# github-runner  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

> For better security with self-hosted code exeuction, make sure to enable
> `Settings -> Actions -> Runners -> Require approval for all outside collaborators`
> in the github repo settings!

Other than that, follow the steps listed under `Settings -> Actions -> Runner ->
Add runner`:

```bash
sudo su github-runner
cd $HOME
<< steps from Web-UI >>
```

When asked for labels, make sure to give it a machine specific tag. For example,
we currenly use the following labels `skylake2x`, `skylake4x`, `cascadelake2x`,
`ryzen5` to indicate different machine type and the number of sockets/NUMA
nodes. Machines with identical hardware should have the same tag to allow
parallel test execution.

> If you add a new machine label, make sure to also add it to `utils.py` in the
> CI website `_scripts` folder.

Don't launch the runner yet with `run.sh` (this happens further below in the doc).

## Give access to the benchmark repository

Benchmark results are uploaded automatically to git.

Generate a key for accessing the repository or use an existing key on the
github-runner account. Also add the user to the KVM group. Adding yourself to
the KVM group requires a logout/reboot which we do in later steps.

```bash
sudo adduser github-runner kvm
ssh-keygen
```

Then, add the pub key (`.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to the github CI account.

## Configure software for the github runner account

Install necessary software for use by the runner:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vmware-labs/node-replicated-kernel.git nrk
cd nrk/
bash setup.sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## Install a recent qemu

[Follow the steps in the Development chapter.](../development/Building.html#install-qemu-from-sources)

## Install memaslap

The memcached benchmark uses the `memaslap` binary that comes with
`libmemcached` but is not included in the Ubuntu libmemcached-tools deb package.
You'll have to install it manually from the sources:

```bash
cd $HOME
sudo apt-get build-dep libmemcached-tools
wget https://launchpad.net/libmemcached/1.0/1.0.18/+download/libmemcached-1.0.18.tar.gz
tar zxvf libmemcached-1.0.18.tar.gz

cd libmemcached-1.0.18/
LDFLAGS='-lpthread' CXXFLAGS='-fpermissive' CFLAGS='-Wno-errors -fpermissive' ./configure --enable-memaslap --with-pthread=yes
make -j12
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

which memaslap
```

## Disable AppArmor

An annoying security feature that blocks our DHCP server from starting for
testing. You can set-up a rule for allowing this but it's easiest to just get
rid of it on the CI machine:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop apparmor
sudo systemctl disable apparmor
sudo apt remove --assume-yes --purge apparmor
# Unfortunately for apparmor and kvm group changes to take effect, we need to reboot:
sudo reboot
```

## Do a test-run

After the reboot, verify that the nrk tests pass (this will take a while, but if
it works CI will likely succeed too):

```bash
# Init submodules if not done so already:
cd nrk
git submodule update --init
source $HOME/.cargo/env

cd kernel
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test --features smoke -- --nocapture
```

## Start the runner

Finally, launch the runner:

```bash
cd $HOME/actions-runner
source $HOME/.cargo/env
./run.sh
```

TBD: Run/configure it as a systemd service.

## Repository settings

If the repo is migrated to a new location, the following settings should be mirrored:

1. Under Settings -> Secrets: Add secret `WEBSITE_DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` which contains
   a key to push the generated documentation to the correct website repository.
1. Under Settings -> Options: Disable "Allow merge commits"
1. Under Settings -> Branches: Add branch protection for `master`, enable the following settings:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Require linear history
1. Under Settings -> Actions -> Runners:
   - "Require approval for all outside collaborators"
