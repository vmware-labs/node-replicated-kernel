//  There are a couple of per-core registers we can use:

//   - TPIDR_EL0:   This is the user-level thread id register for user-level TLS data.
//                  we don't use this in the kernel.
//   - TPIDRRO_EL0: This is the read-only version and we can use this for the process control block.
//                  it's read only in user-space
//   - TPIDR_EL1:   This is the kernel-level thread id register for kernel-level TLS data.
//                  and for the KCB etc.
